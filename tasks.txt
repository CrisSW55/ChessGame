Today, I will add a Mouse Listener. It has mouse events which are used to
provide the position in with the event was clicked on. In this instance, the
current mouse event position and the current chess piece position would be used
to confirm the current chess piece. This allows getting the correct chess piece
when clicking it. Later, the chess piece will be moved, according to the correct
specific chess piece potential movements. For example, the pawn can move once or
twice initially, at start game only. After that, the pawn may only move once forward
only, whenever clear forward path. Another piece, the bishop, can move diagonally
only without any ally pieces in the way.

//Make sure mouse listener it clicking over a chess piece
//Next, confirm the specific chess piece -> setConfirmedPiece();
//Assign id 0-5; for each specific piece, pawn = 0, rook = 1, knight = 2, bishop = 3, queen = 4, king = 5
//Successfully added selected square position when selecting a chess piece
//color changed to yellow
